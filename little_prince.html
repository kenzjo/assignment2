<br/>
As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in <br/>my arms and set out walking once more.
<div id ="1">I felt deeply <br/>moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was <br/>carrying a very fragile treasure.</div>
<div id="2">It seemed to me, even, <br/>that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</div>
In the <br/>moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed <br/>eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I <br/>said to myself:
<div id ="3">"What I see here is nothing but a <br/>shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</div>
<br/>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a <br/>half-smile, I said to myself, again: <div id="4">"What moves me <br/>so 
deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping <br/>here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose <br/>that shines 
through his whole being like the flame <br/>of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </div> And I felt <br/>him to be more fragile 
still. <div id="5"> I felt the need of <br/>protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that <br/>might be extinguished by 
a little puff of wind..." </div>
